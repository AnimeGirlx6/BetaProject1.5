# BetaProject1.5 
there are 2 folder the root folder LOG and includes 
LOG contains all the stuff that we use normally eg:
header, footer, login, signup
while includes( which are identified by either -in.php or -inc.php)
the naming confention does not change anything its just for naming.

I didn't make a the login part because I can't move on until I fix the failed statement error
in the sign up page.
